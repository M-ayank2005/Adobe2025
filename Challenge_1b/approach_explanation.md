# Approach Explanation - Challenge 1B

## Methodology Overview

Our persona-driven document intelligence system employs a multi-layered approach to extract and prioritize relevant content from document collections based on specific user personas and their job-to-be-done.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Document Processing Engine
We utilize a lightweight PDF processing pipeline built with PyPDF2 and pdfplumber that:
- Extracts text with font metadata for heading detection
- Identifies document structure through font-based analysis
- Applies pattern recognition for common heading formats
- Maintains page-level granularity for precise referencing

### 2. Persona-Based Analysis Framework
Our semantic analyzer implements a weighted keyword matching system with:
- **Primary Keywords**: High-impact terms specific to each persona (weight: 3.0)
- **Secondary Keywords**: Supporting terms that provide context (weight: 1.0)
- **Task-Specific Terms**: Dynamic extraction based on job-to-be-done (weight: 2.0)
- **Direct Word Matching**: Explicit task description analysis (weight: 1.5)

### 3. Relevance Scoring Algorithm
Content relevance is determined through:
- Weighted keyword density analysis
- Persona-specific vocabulary matching
- Task-contextual term identification
- Normalized scoring (0-1 scale) for consistent ranking

### 4. Content Extraction Strategy
The system prioritizes content through:
- **Importance Ranking**: Top 10 most relevant sections per collection
- **Multi-Document Analysis**: Cross-document pattern recognition
- **Context Preservation**: Maintaining section-to-document relationships
- **Refined Text Generation**: Enhanced content extraction with surrounding context

## Key Innovations

### Adaptive Persona Recognition
Our system supports diverse personas including researchers, analysts, students, and professionals by dynamically matching vocabulary patterns rather than using fixed rule sets.

### Hierarchical Content Analysis
We analyze content at multiple levels:
- Document-level metadata extraction
- Section-level importance ranking
- Subsection-level refined text analysis

### Scalable Processing Pipeline
The architecture handles 3-10 documents efficiently while maintaining sub-60-second processing times through:
- Optimized text extraction algorithms
- Efficient memory management
- Streamlined analysis workflows

## Technical Implementation

### Performance Optimization
- **CPU-Only Processing**: No GPU dependencies for maximum compatibility
- **Memory Efficient**: Streaming text processing for large documents
- **Fast Extraction**: Character-level font analysis for heading detection
- **Offline Operation**: Zero network dependencies

### Output Generation
The system produces structured JSON outputs containing:
- Complete metadata with processing context
- Ranked section extractions with importance scores
- Detailed subsection analysis with refined content
- Page-level references for source traceability

This approach ensures robust, scalable, and accurate persona-driven document analysis suitable for diverse use cases and document types.
